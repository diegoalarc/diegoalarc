## ðŸ˜„ *Hello, my name is Diego AlarcÃ³n.*

ðŸ”­ I am a Chilean passionate about codes and the possibilities that this can generate for all of us in our future. I am also a [surveying engineer](http://www.geomensura.usach.cl/) and I am currently in Germany studying [EAGLE](http://eagle-science.org/).

ðŸŒ± Currently I can say that I handle a little more than basic:

- [R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/)
- [Python](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html#what-next)
- [Google Earth Engine](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/end-to-end-gee.html)

ðŸ˜„ I am constantly learning since science and codes do not stop!!

## ðŸ“« *How to contact me?*
I invite you to visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoalarc%C3%B3nd%C3%ADaz/) and to contact me !!
